# Calendar-Management-System 

The Calendar Management System (CMS) displays calendar for the desired week,
month, or year. Also, CMS organizes personal tasks of different users in specific day. The users
should be able to see their individual calendar data & update them. Our CMS will store the data
of different users in distinct secure text files. 

Please refrence this GitHub, if going to use any part of our code.

Thank you,
